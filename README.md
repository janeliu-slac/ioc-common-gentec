# ioc-common-gentec
This is an EPICS IOC that is used at LCLS. This repo was automatically transferred to github from an internal filesystem repository via the scripts at https://github.com/pcdshub/afs_ioc_migration.

The original filesystem location was /afs/slac.stanford.edu/g/cd/swe/git/repos/package/epics/ioc/common/gentec.git.


## Original readme files
### README
TODO: Add notes on how to build and run this IOC,
along with any useful information that would help
someone else to support this IOC if needed.
